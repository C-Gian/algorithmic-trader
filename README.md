# Algorithmic Trader

Algorithmic Trader is a clean-room BTC-only research and paper-trading project whose goal is to translate professional market-reading and trade-decision practice into a deterministic, inspectable software trader.

## Current state

The project is in **operational-shell bootstrap (WP-001)**. The repository contains the accepted foundation, the professional source dossiers and a runnable shell driven by a scripted **DEMO dummy trader** on a **synthetic** BTC-perpetual fixture. The real trader has not been implemented; nothing the shell shows is market data or research evidence.

## Read first

1. `FOUNDATION.md` — canonical product, architecture and research directive.
2. `STATE.md` — current milestone, active task and next action.
3. `AGENTS.md` — executor workflow and clean-room rules.
4. `task.md` — the single current task to implement.
5. `source_notes/` and `knowledge/registry.yaml` — professional knowledge provenance.

## Product scope

Initial paper operation is **BTC perpetual futures**, LONG/SHORT/NO_TRADE, with no leverage above 1x exposure. Intended trades are short-duration (generally minutes to hours), while broader horizons may inform market context.

No real-money trading is authorized.

## Start the application

One command (Docker + Docker Compose required):

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>. Click **Start synthetic replay** to launch a run; the worker executes it independently of the browser. `docker compose down` stops the stack (add `--volumes` to delete the database and run artifacts).

Without Docker (local PostgreSQL 18, Python via `uv`, Node 24):

```sh
uv sync --locked
npm --prefix web ci && npm --prefix web run build
export ALGOTRADER_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASS@localhost:5432/algotrader   # existing, empty database
uv run algotrader serve          # migrates, starts a supervised worker + API on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Useful environment variables: `ALGOTRADER_ARTIFACT_ROOT` (default `./var/artifacts`, outside Git), `ALGOTRADER_PORT`, `ALGOTRADER_LEASE_SECONDS`.

## Operation

- **Runs**: start (replay speed, optional DEMO fault injection), cancel, status, progress, elapsed time, heartbeat, attempt, failure text and recovery log.
- **Home / current run**: DEMO/SYNTHETIC banner, simulation time, synthetic price chart, latest MarketView, decision/action and reason (including risk blocks), paper position, action history.
- **Artifacts**: every completed/cancelled/failed run writes `manifest.json`, Parquet records (events, market views, decisions, risk decisions, plans, orders, fills, account/equity, observations), `validation.json` and `report.md` under `<artifact root>/runs/<run_id>/`. They are listed and viewable in the UI and via `GET /api/runs/{id}/manifest` and `/api/runs/{id}/artifacts[/{name}[?format=json]]`.
- **Fault injection (DEMO)**: `crash worker once` kills the worker process mid-step; after the lease expires a restarted worker resumes from the last committed checkpoint. `crash worker every attempt` ends as `failed` with an explanation after 3 attempts.
- `uv run algotrader replay` runs the engine in-process and prints the semantic trace hash.

## Checks

```sh
uv sync --locked
npm --prefix web ci
npm --prefix web run typecheck
npm --prefix web run build
uv run playwright install chromium            # once; CI uses --with-deps

# Database tests create/drop throwaway databases on this server:
export ALGOTRADER_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:PASS@localhost:5432/postgres
uv run pytest --ignore=tests/e2e              # unit, contracts, accounting, determinism, idempotency/recovery, API
uv run pytest tests/e2e                       # browser UI -> API -> worker process -> PostgreSQL -> UI
python scripts/stack_smoke.py http://127.0.0.1:8000   # against a running stack
```

Without `ALGOTRADER_TEST_DATABASE_URL` the database tests are skipped (CI sets `ALGOTRADER_REQUIRE_DB=1`, which turns that into a failure). CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs all of the above and a Docker Compose smoke.
